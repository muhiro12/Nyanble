/// - The `fetchCurrentLocation()` method provides a suspendable way to get the current location once,
///   suitable for single-use location requests.
/// - It also handles location authorization and fallback coordinates internally,
///   ensuring a reliable location is always returned.
/// - Continuous location updates are available via the `locationUpdates()` AsyncStream, and current location
///   is published via the `@Published var location`.
///
/// This class fully integrates LocationFetcher features for single-shot and streaming location needs.
